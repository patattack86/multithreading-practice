## going to run two programs in parellel. one will give the the square, the other will give the cube of each number in an array
## using multi threading we can reduce the time of computation


import time
import threading

def calc_square(numbers):
    for n in numbers:
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print('Square: ', n^2)
       

def calc_cube(numbers):
    for n in numbers:
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print('Cube: ', n^3)
        
arr = [2,4,6,8,10,12]

t1.start()
